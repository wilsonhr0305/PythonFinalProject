# Coal Ash Environmental Impact Script
# December 11, 2017

What:
I created a python script for ArcMap that takes an area of interest, watersheds, rivers, soil data, land use data, and a DEM as inputs
and outputs a raster file displaying the severity of environmental impact should a leak occur from a coal ash containment site.

Modules Used:
ArcPy

Why:
This model was developed of a project in another class. I wanted to create a script so the process can easily be repeated for multiple areas.

# Parameters
AOI = area of interest
HUC12 = watersheds
Rivers = rivers and waterways
SoilData = statsgo
LandUse = nlcd
DEM = 10m dem
input_folder = input environment
output_folder = output environment
